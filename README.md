# hello-world
Hey, I'm learning
This is my first time using Github a few days after finishing my last assignment for the OOP course in DIT.
I just emailed Svetlana to thank her for all her help and to confirm that she got the assignment
I showed the assignment to XC a few mins ago and immeadiately found some minor errors. 
This is all happening during the Covid-19 lockdown after losing my hours in Emerald and hoping to never go back there.
